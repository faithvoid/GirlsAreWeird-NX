# GirlsAreWeird-NX
Unofficial port of the Ren'Py visual novel "Girls Are Weird" by bentosmile, using the Ren'Py Switch SDK. This repository does not include the renpy-switch.elf file as it's too large, and you'll probably want to use an updated version anyhow.

## TODO:
Convert .rpy and .py files for faster boot times.

## Bugs:
You tell me!
